* notes
Personal notes that I take, view this on the web at [[notes][https://notes.wyli.tech]]
This repo uses the Org-Roam packages which allows me to connect notes easily.

** Publishing

To publish a new update to the notes, making sure you have [[https://github.com/jgru/org-roam-ui/tree/add-export-capability][this fork and tree of org-roam-ui]], run src_elisp{org-roam-ui-export}

and select the directory as `src\`

afterwards, assuming you are using doom emacs, you can patch the org-roam-ui server by running

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo bash build-standalone-server.sh /home/wyli/org/notes/src
#+END_SRC

where the build-standalone-server.sh is where the git repo for emacs is stored

afterwards you can copy the contents directly to `/out` here using

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
cp -r out/ ~/org/notes/
#_END_SRC

and then you're set.
