* notes
Personal notes that I take, view this on the web at [[https://notes.wyli.tech][notes]]
This repo uses the Org-Roam packages which allows me to connect notes easily.

** Publishing

To publish a new update to the notes, making sure you have [[https://github.com/jgru/org-roam-ui/tree/add-export-capability][this fork and tree of org-roam-ui]], run

#+BEGIN_src elisp
org-roam-ui-export
#+END_src

and select the directory as `src\`

afterwards, assuming you are using doom emacs, you can patch the org-roam-ui server by running

#+BEGIN_src bash
sudo bash build-standalone-server.sh /home/wyli/org/notes/src
#+END_src

where the build-standalone-server.sh is where the git repo for emacs is stored (around `~/.config/emacs/.local/straight/repos/org-roam-ui/standalone/` for me) (you need docker)

afterwards you can copy the contents directly to `/out` here using

#+BEGIN_src bash
cp -r out/ ~/org/notes/
#+END_src

and then you're set.
