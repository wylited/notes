The production possibility curve model illustrates the combinations of [[id:75b2b0fb-068b-4f77-9362-e90fca759456][production]] quantities of two different [[id:c01a807f-754c-4a35-a42b-77a67828f82d][goods or services]] an [[id:908979e3-4240-4b4d-ad02-62e08dcc0795][economy]] can produce.

It makes 4 assumptions:
- There is a fixed amount of resources
- Only two goods are being produced
- Technology and production techniques are fixed
- All resources are used efficiently

PPF stands for Production Possibility Frontier, the actual line of the PPC.

[[file:images/ppc_diagram.png][PPC Diagram]]

A) within the PPC representing inefficient allocation of resources
B) on the PPF representing efficient allocation of resources, with more being allocated to good Y than X.
C) outside of the PPC representing an unatainable production point
D) The same as B, but with more resources allocated to good X than Y.

A outwards shift in the PPF represents [[id:fb5b1a7e-b5e8-4cf6-852c-4aa1462b3205][economic growth]].

The gradient of the PPC also represents [[id:d93b7dbb-b3e7-4ecc-a2c1-17e0cba45cb8][opportunity cost]].
