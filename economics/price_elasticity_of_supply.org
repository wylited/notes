:ID:       a7338fe2-56f5-4163-b660-7cba5e7ac5c1
:ROAM_ALIASES: PES
:END:
 A measure of the responsiveness of [[id:75f15db8-9331-495e-90ef-f3f68e7efd23][supply]] to a change in price, [[id:c56c7674-407f-4711-a829-50f195e1a0f8][determinants]].

 $PES  = \frac{\% \Delta Q_s}{\% \Delta P}$

** Applications
1) Primary commodoties have a lower PES than manufactured goods because
   1) Time to respond is higher
   2) Low mobility
   3) Limited land
   4) Time is required for investements
   5) Technological Requirements
