*  TODO Gender Divides at my School :gender:
A couple of days ago in my english class, we had to split into three groups for a author presentation. One group formed with 6 girls, the other two groups consisted of me and a friend and another group of 3 other guys. The teacher had wanted the groups to be equally divided so that the work wouldn't be burdensome on any. Yet the groups were uneven and I had to present everything myself. :

We can look introspectively into my year groups social interactions to understand phenomena alike to my experience that repeatedly occur on a daily basis.
