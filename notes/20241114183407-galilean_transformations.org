#+title: Galilean Transformations

* Galilean Transformations
The mathematical expressions that relate measurements between different inertial [[id:4fe49e8e-9236-47bd-ba48-4ed125145d3e][frames]] in [[id:b8bc6c39-75cc-4a88-9229-63243ccfa00c][classical mechanics]]:

- Space transformations
  $$ x' = x - vt $$
  $$ y' = y $$
  $$ z' = z $$

- Time transformations
  $$ t' = t $$

- Velocity transformations
  $$ u' = u - v$$

Where:
- $(x', y', z', t')$ are the coordinates of the observed frame
- $(x, y, z, t)$ are the coordinates of the observer frame
- $v$ is the relative velocity between the frames
- $u$ is the velocity of the observer frame
- $u'$ is the velocity of the observed frame

These transformations assume:
1. Absolute time (time is the same for all observers)
2. Absolute space (spatial measurements are the same for all observers)

Limitations: Only valid at speeds much lower than light speed (v << c), at higher speeds [[id:ca3ab0b5-948d-4cb7-8642-23c35e4adbea][lorentz transformations]] are accurate.
