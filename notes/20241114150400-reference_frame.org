#+title: Reference Frame

* Reference Frame
A reference frame or frame of reference is an abstract set of coordinates where at each coordinate the [[id:e3c5c6ba-e046-41b6-8fe6-64a89cc0ab3d][time]] is the same for all observers.
With respect to a reference frame, one can observe the motion of another object.

If the frame is not accelerating, the frame is referred to as a inertial reference frame.
