#+title: Magnetic Force
* Magnetic Force $F_m$

The magnetic [[id:afae86d7-adba-4683-a91f-5ce11d834da7][force]] on a charged particle is given by the equation

$$ F_m = qvB \sin(\theta) $$

where $q$ is the charge of the particle, $v$ is the velocity, $B$ is the magnetic field strength
and $\theta$ is the angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field. Which can also be represented using the cross product.

$$ F_m = q\vec{v} \times \vec{B} $$
