#+title: Collision

* Collision
A short-duration interaction between two bodies or more causing a change in motion.

All collisions [[id:56ebac53-0f41-46cf-9f52-b20809cea750][conserve momentum]].

A collision is elastic when kinetic energy is conserved.
inelastic if total kinetic energy is lower.
and an explosion if total kinetic energy is larger.
