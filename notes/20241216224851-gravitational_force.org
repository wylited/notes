* Gravitational Force $F_g$
Is a field [[id:afae86d7-adba-4683-a91f-5ce11d834da7][force]] that describes the "weight" of a body given through

$$ F_g = mg $$

where $g$ is gravitational [[id:a9074e56-9216-4f34-bb27-fd753325f667][acceleration]].

$ F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} $

where $G$ is the gravitational constant, $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the bodies, and $r$ is the distance between them.
