#+title: Galilean Relativity
* Galilean Relativity
Galilean relativity states that the [[id:25c18b76-44de-4d7b-8c7f-54a2c6d99818][laws of motion]] are the same in all inertial [[id:4fe49e8e-9236-47bd-ba48-4ed125145d3e][frames of reference]].

We can describe relative motion with [[id:764a93ce-2166-44d0-989b-11e980137c73][position]] and [[id:e3c5c6ba-e046-41b6-8fe6-64a89cc0ab3d][time]] with two reference frames $S$ and $S'$. Since time is absolute.

$$ t = t' $$

There will be some [[id:e646ac15-08f6-4657-818a-f46be8078f65][distance]] $vt$ displacing the second observer at $x'$

$$  x' = x - vt $$

These are some of the Galilean Transformationsi

The [[id:0517a9e5-92f8-4613-99ce-d770dbe1eb28][velocity]] can be determined by taking the [[id:34d5f0fe-b4e0-4989-acd9-ab050688f390][derivative of position]].

$$ \frac{d}{dt}x' = \frac{d}{dt}(x-vt) = \frac{d}{dt}x - v $$

This is the velocity addition equation, stating that the velocity of a inertial reference frame can be found by taking the velocity of an observer inertial reference frame and adding the observed velocity of the first inertial reference frame.

However, this contradicts the principle of [[id:3daa230b-a4d0-40d3-98ba-f6d495cfd3a0][light speed invariance]], and thus the framework is only useful at low speeds.
