* Equations of Motion
When under uniform [[id:a9074e56-9216-4f34-bb27-fd753325f667][acceleration]], the equations of [[id:6b5390e2-cf7e-4005-8f8e-0d1d7b08487e][uniform motion]] are used to describe the motion of an object between two points at a constant acceleration.

TODO
Under uniform angular acceleration, which is *not* constant acceleration, the equations of angular motion are used to describe the motion of body around a fixed point.
