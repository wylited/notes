* Linear Momentum
Describing the movement of a particle in relation to its mass. For a single particle:

$$ p = mv $$
where $m$ is mass, and $v$ is velocity

The momentum of a system is the vector sum of their momenta.

$$ p = \sum{m_i v_i}_i $$

In a closed system, linear [[id:56ebac53-0f41-46cf-9f52-b20809cea750][momentum is conserved]].
