If you do not center your analysis around the guiding question, you will <b>not</b> get high marks. Simple as that.\nLet&apos;s look at a range of guiding questions:\n</p><p>How is the significance of the death of Mr. Mallard established and developed in this passage?\nIn what ways does the use of imagery help to create atmosphere in the poem?\nWhat tensions are created in the descriptions in these paragraphs\nHow are the relationships between the characters presented in this extract?\nHow does the poem’s form contribute to its mood and the development of ideas?\nHow personification/metaphor/simile used in this poem to portray the night?\nHow does the poem use compressed/concentrated language to express complex ideas and/or feelings?\n</p><p>Although not always the case, we can notice that most guiding questions outline a technique and sometimes its effect.\nWhy is this important? Because it will serve as a foundation for our <b>thesis statement</b>.\nFirst, let&apos;s talk about our <b>thesis statement</b>, an effective thesis will plan an argument for us. This is because an argument tends to lend to a predetermined essay structure.\nHow do we create this argument? Well, once you read the text, there is almost always an interplay/dichotomy/tension between two key concepts creating the effect. Nine out of ten times, it&apos;s Nature vs. Artificial. Nature vs. Artificial is always a good argument to make, and it&apos;s so prevalent everywhere.\nSo how does the technique play into making the argument? We can split our general technique into the two key concepts again. This is better shown with an example.\nSay our technique provided is Imagery. Taking Nature vs. Artificial, the beginning of our <b>thesis statement</b> can take the form of\nThe author presents a dichotomy/tension between natural imagery and artificial imagery in order to create effect.\nNow, you need to also be careful when implementing the effect. You absolutely need to discuss a specific effect. What do I mean by that?\nSay, for example, our effect is Atmosphere. We cannot just say in order to create atmosphere, but what type of atmosphere? This could be melancholic or eulogical, maybe foreshadowing, cacolgic, nostalgic, hopeful or reminiscent. You get my point, try to be specific and correct to the text about the type of effect created.\nAnd finally, possibly most importantly, we have the part that the question will not ask. Why?. In your essay, you must answer why the effect is being created through the technique. Here, we need to consider the authorial intent or edifying message.\nThis will help us finalize our <b>thesis statement</b>.\nThe author presents a dichotomy/tension between natural imagery and artificial imagery to create an effect  in order to convey an idea …\nHowever, our why will go further than just the introduction&apos;s <b>thesis statement</b>, in our conclusion, we must also consider the global and wider perspective of the reader in relation to the edifying message. You want to say something insightful and nuanced about the text and how it relates to literature as a whole.\nSo to recap, our <b>thesis statement</b> presents a dichotomy or tension between two sides of a technique, to create a specific effect in order to convey an idea. And our conclusion focuses on the wider implications of this idea the author raises.\n</p></section><h2>The Structure</h2><section><p>You have a few options for structuring your essay. Assuming that we are aiming for an introduction, 3 body paragraphs and a conclusion, you can either structure it thematically, chronologically or technically.\nA technical structure would lend the topic sentence of each body paragraph to a certain technique, and the effect is created.\nA chronological structure will analyze the text in the same order that the text would be read.\nA thematic structure will focus each body paragraph on a specific theme, in relation to the question.\nAll of these structures have their pros and cons, and I won&apos;t be the one to tell you which one to use, as it depends on your style.\nHowever, what I will suggest using is a mixed structure that develops off of your thesis. What do I mean? If you followed the same way to create a thesis as outlined above, you can structure your body paragraphs based off of your argument.\nThe first thematic technique, perhaps Natural Imagery and the effect it builds\nThe second thematic technique, Artificial imagery and the effect it builds.\nThe interplay/tension between the two techniques and the effect it builds.\nThis lends very well while planning, as you don&apos;t actually need to plan your structure beyond the thesis!\n</p></section></main>"

They typically constantly defy societal expectations, are a higher class than most people and yet are adored by the masses. Why is this?\n</p><p>Recently we studied about Arthur Miller, a strong criticst of the American Dream. He was often unfairly accused of being a communist due to his connections and associations. We will use him as an analysis point for this claim.\n</p><p>Lets first begin with why he was a strong crictist. Arthur Miller was born in Harlem, New York City with two successful middle class workers for his parents. Following the Wall Street crash of 1929, the Miller family fell into a crisis. Suddenly, their house in Harlem and their summer house were sold for a chummy place in Brooklyn. Throughout his childhood, Arthur Miller experienced both the highs and lows of the American Dream. He learned from an early to be a rationalist criticist.\n</p><p>Once Arthur Miller started his career. His plays tended to criticized the American Dream, such as the play, &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, where Miller grapples with the loss of identity and a mans fall following an ability to accept change within himself and society. This play was heavily criticized and boycotted by the American Legion due to the themes that were critical of the American Dream and capitalism. Through the &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; Arthur Miller presented a strong criticism against the lusted-over American Dream.\n</p><p>Likewise, the play &quot;The Crucible&quot; was a commentary of the Red Scare and McArthyism induced fear and anxiety in the American society as well as the atmost unfair treatment. &quot;The Crucible&quot; achieved this by reflecting the contemporary issue with the Salem Witch trials of the late 1700&apos;s. The Crucible was so popular and sucessful, that it single handed made the Salem Witch Trials famous. On an even deeper level, Arthur Miller himself was persecuted with the same accusatory trials that the Salem Witch Trials showcases as injust and unfair. What likely influenced Miller to write this play was his connections to the League of American Writers, comprised mostly of communists, as well as the Federal Theatre Project, which got closed in 1939 due to Congress worries over Communist infiltration.\n</p><p>Arthur Miller was also born Jewish-Polish, although he was never overly religious, he often spoke out against anti-semistic behaviour and attempted to get many plays showcased about anti-semistism. However, these plays were never shown to an audience due to the American Theatre refusing to deal with controversial topics. In frustration that his plays were constantly being denied, Arthur Miller decided to write a speech titled &quot;Concerning the Jews who Write&quot; and later his first novel &quot;Focus&quot;, a titular reference to jewish concentration camps, discusses discrimination in post World War 2 America and the issue of scapegoating.\n</p><p>&lt; I could another reference to how Arthur Miller was against Misogyny and refused to sexually exploit Marilyn Monroe, but thats not a good point &gt;\n</p><p>So we can see how several societal aspects can influence an artists life and cause them to stand out and voice their opinions. This key trait they have makes them unique and sought-after, raising them to fame and popularity. We can observe the raw desire for controversy and change humans encompass and the extent to which they idolize but also criticize those who embody it.\n</p></section></main>"

Quite often, they change. They could be described as implicit behaviour or even better a mental software, software that constantly updates.\n</p><p>What is the &quot;Guarding&quot; mental framework. I like to think the highest or encompassing mental framework is the one that filters our inputs and outputs. It helps us understand reality and filters how we respond. A popular choice for a guarding mental framework is the stoic philosophy, where one must not react to input, self-control as a means of overcoming emotions, the becoming of the unbiased thinker. A mentat, as Herbet would put it.\n</p><p>Stoicism claims to allow one to understand the <i>&quot;universal reason&quot;</i>, described by the Greeks as logos; pure logic itself.\nHowever, for almost everbody, a guarding mental framework will be far more complex than taking all input and outputting nothing.\n</p><p>Personally, my guarding mental framework is what provides me with <b>mental stability</b>. Mental Stability is  highly sought after, as allows people to properly cope with constant change and fluctuations in their life. However, I did not benefit from this since birth, it constantly went through trials and tribulations to achieve what it is today.\n</p><p>Nowadays, the access to revelating information is unrestricted but people fail to act on it. When I was faced with mental challenges, I often times looked to external content to understand how to correct my mental framework. The complexity in the framework, almost like a firewall, arose when I began to pick parts of external frameworks that the best thinkers in humankind have crafted. I picked what felt mentally suitable for me and integrated it into my everyday. This is a part that not everyone can do, although they may be consuming revelating knowledge, it has no real revelation on them.\n</p><p>But although this system of integrating new concepts into our philosophies is not disadvantageous surface level, they can expose flaws in our foundation. What I mean by this is when the revelation is so deep and embeded within you that you need to rework everything from the ground up. I refer to this as <i>&quot;nuking&quot;</i> and I am guilty of doing this way too often. The biggest vulnerability this exposes is that your mental framework is not guarding you. Often times, during my nuking experience, while I am still rebuilding my mental framework, I often feel a surge of emotions, panic, sadness, anger that is uncontrollable and overwhelming. I am further guilty of often doing this with external projects, completly restarting my computer science game 50 hours in or resetting my entire operating system or code editor to remove <i>&quot;bloat&quot;</i>. After all, a tower of babel requires a solid foundation first.\n</p><p>I kinda forgot what I wanted to finish this with.\nProbably a major issue in my expression mental framework, kinda concerning.\nGonna go practice some french text type writing now.\n</p></section></main>"

I mean to take no offense to them personally, but their public exhibition of laziness creates a mental link in the observers relating those who are lazy or sleeping all the time and being in the lowest class of human beings.\n</p><p>The effect is exemplified through the contrast between me and my father at home. my father, who grew up in india  and was exposed to the lower cases, developed a natural inhibition towards laziness most commonly portrayed through sleeping during the day or slacking off. On the other hand, since I was raised in a developed country, I did not witness such behaviour and form those links.\n</p><p>This lead to several arguments, where I am convinced that me napping during the day is just to recuperate physical and mental strength, while my dad believes that I have become lazy and complacent.\n</p><p>Although this is not a bad mentality for societ to adopt, it presents how easily prejudcies can be formed in our soicety through our constant judgement. It also showcases a form of neurological evolution as a result of social interactions. People observee that being lazy is frowned upon, and thus strive to be productive to the economy in order to achieve most peoples common goal of societal acceptance.\n</p></section></main>"

This is due to their firm positioning in the ecological system. Agricultural societies of the past took these staple foods like rice, potato, wheat and millet in order to sustain their diet. This choice was made, as the name would suggest, is because these foods could resist ecological or environmental fluctuations, and thus was an stable investment for humans to make. As a result the diets of whole communities, especially in poorer regions, because dependent on the harvest of a single plant. An example of this how Nepali communities are so dependent on millet to the point where there local government tends to subsidize it and Old Irish Villages dependency on potatos.\n</p><p>As you may figure, a completely reliance on a singular crop carries terrible risks to individuals and societies. At a large scale, a whole vilalge is easily vulnerable to a unforseen shift in weather or incursion of a natural disater. A singular drought or famine for a certain crop could wipe out a majority of the population in one fell swoop.\n</p><p>Furthermore, the effects of relying on a staple crop for all meals is terrible for human diet. A human diet needs to be varied in order to supply our body with all the macro and micro nutrients it needs to function. Unfortunately no singular crop is a &quot;super food&quot; and is unable to provide us with all of the nutrients we require. This further mentally and physically cripples those in the communities, forcing them to remain stuck in a undeveloped and often impovershed status.\n</p><p>In conclusion, this is why its extremely important for us to have a balanced of a diet as possible. We should all take a note out of our ancestors who were foragers and gatherers. They constantly were moving around, eating different types of food whatever they could find and not forcing an inherently flawed crop to be over cultivated. This key focus on our diet and what we eat will allow ourselves to maximise our lives potential.\n</p></section></main>"
