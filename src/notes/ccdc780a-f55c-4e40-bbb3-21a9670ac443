Responsiveness of the quantity [[id:756af077-e7cc-47b1-b656-2823facfb950][demanded]] to a change in its price of an [[id:c01a807f-754c-4a35-a42b-77a67828f82d][economic good]], [[id:590be4ac-7a1a-43f3-b535-36a4d062987a][determinants]].

$$PED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P}$$

Calculated PED is always negative, but is discussed as its absolute value.

PED is the percentage change in quantity demand over the percentage change in price, and represents the gradient of a demand curve.


| Value | Term              |
|-------+-------------------|
| 0     | Fixed             |
| 0 - 1 | Inelastic         |
| 1     | Unitary elastic   |
| > 1   | Elastic           |
| \infty     | Perfectly elastic |


** Applications
1) PED & Total Revenue
   - with elastic demand
     + \downarrow TR = \uparrow P \times \downarrow Q
     + \uparrow TR = \downarrow P \times \uparrow Q (lucrative option)
   - with inelastic demand
     + \uparrow TR = \uparrow P \times \downarrow Q (lucrative option)
     + \downarrow TR = \downarrow P \times \uparrow Q

Firms should use PED to choose the lucrative option in order to increase total revenue

2) The more inelasitc the PED of the taxed good is, the more revenue the government recieves.
