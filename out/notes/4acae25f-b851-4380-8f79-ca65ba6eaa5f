The [[id:09482338-43cc-4a77-bf7f-6ed732eb21a8][economic]] concept that there are unlimited [[id:756af077-e7cc-47b1-b656-2823facfb950][wants]] but limited resources.
This raises threats to [[id:0cce8755-43bc-45fe-abe6-8dc298e3043f][sustainability]], as well as the three basic economic questions:
1) What to produce?
2) How to produce?
3) Who to produce for?
