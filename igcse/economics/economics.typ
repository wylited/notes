= Preface
This is a revision guide made for the IGCSE Economics course. It is not made to be used on its own, but rather to promote understanding and help condense and compress key information in the course. This allows for a more efficient revision process, and helps students make connections between topics efficiently. This greatly helps for the extended response questions.


I hope you enjoy reading this and make good use of the revision notes.


= Brief Overview of the Course
The IGCSE Economics course is split into 2 sections, each of the sections having their own exam paper, Macroeconomics and Microeconomics.


Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole, whereas Microeconomics focuses on the individual parts of the economy like households and firms.


Both papers are 80 marks in 90 minutes and are under codes 04/EC01 and 04/Ec02 for micro and macro respectively.


== Assessment Objectives

= Microeconomics
== The Economic Problem: Scarcity
"There is a _finite_ amount of reosources and an _infinite_ amount of wants."


Meaning, the *demand* for economic goods is higher than the *supply*.


This is the basic *economic problem,* which leads to 3 questions:
+ What to produce? (not all goods and services can be produced)
+ How to produce? (different production methods)
+ For whom to produce? (different groups of people who need it, how much they should get)


This requires *decision makers* to make a choice. This is called *opportunity cost*.


Decision makers are:
+ *Governments*
+ *Producers*
+ *Consumers*


The *opportunity cost* is the cost of giving up _the next best alternative_ when a choice is made.


Choosing what goods to produce is an opportunity cost, This can be illustrated using a PPC (Production Possibility Curve).


The PPC shows the maximum amount of goods that can be produced with the available resources. It often shows the relationship between two goods.


#figure(
 image("graphics/ppc.svg", width: 50%),
 caption: [
   A production possibility curve illustrating the relationship between the production of a good X and Y.
 ],
)


+ Point B is unachievable (due to a lack of resources)
+ Point E & D are inefficient (waste of resources)
+ Point A & C are efficient (maximizing output with the resources available)




=== Economic Growth
The increased production of goods and services in an economy over a period of time, or GDP.


Factors that affect economic growth:
+ *Population growth* - more people = more demand
+ *Labour productivity* - more output per worker
+ *Capital productivity* - more output per unit of capital
+ *Technological change* - new technology = more output
+ *Natural resources* - more resources = more output


Economic Growth influences the PPC, as it shifts it outwards (increase in production).


=== Economic Assumptions
Economists make assumptions about the economy to make it easier to analyse and understand.
Economists assume that individuals will behave rationally:
+ Consumers aim to maximize benefits or util.
+ Producers aim to maximize profits.


However, there are reasons why this may not be true:
+ For consumers:
   + *Information asymmetry* - consumers may not have all the information
   + *Moral hazard* - consumers may not be able to control their spending, (addictions)
   + *bandwagon effect* - consumers may copy other consumers behaviour
+ For producers:
   + *Social enterprise* - producers may not be motivated by profit
   + Performance may be influenced by other aims like selling more goods
   + Producer has alternative business objectives.

== Demand and Supply
=== Demand
"The amount of an economic good that would be bought at a certain price point."


Demand and *price* are _inversely proportional_. This means that as the price of a good *increases*, the demand for it *decreases* (typically). So, a change in price results in movement along the demand curve.


The demand curve illustrates this relationship as a line. The demand curve is _downward sloping_ and is denoted with a capital D.


#figure(
   image("graphics/demand.png", width: 50%),
   caption: [
       A demand curve showing the relationship between price and quantity demanded at different price points.
   ],
)


==== Factors affecting Demand


The demand curve is affected by 6 non-price factors:
+ *Fashion & Taste* - (proportional)
+ *Disposable Income* - if average income increases, demand increases (proportional)
+ *Price of Complementary goods* - if price of complementary goods increase, demand for the good decreases (inversely proportional)
+ *Price of Substitute goods* - if price of substitute goods increase, demand for the good increases (proportional)
+ *Advertising* - if advertising increases, demand increases (proportional)
+ *Demographics* - if there is a larger demographic that a product targets, demand increases (proportional)


These factors cause shifts in the demand curve -
#figure(
   image("graphics/demand-shift.svg", width: 50%),
   caption: [When demand shifts to the left, quantity falls. When demand shifts to the right, quantity rises.]
)


==== Price Elasticity of Demand


The *price elasticity of demand* is the responsiveness of demand to a change in price. It is measured by the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price.


Note: Price elasticity of demand is _always_ a _negative_ number.


PED is equal to the change in quantity of demand over the change in price. This is also the gradient of the curve.


$ P = (Delta D%) / (Delta P%) $


For the absolute values of PED:
#table(
   columns: 2,
   [value], [description],
   [x = 0], [fixed demand],
   [0 < x < 1], [inelastic],
   [x = 1], [unit elastic],
   [x > 1], [elastic],
   [x = $infinity$], [perfectly elastic],
)
The categories of goods depending on their PED.
#image("graphics/goodtypes.png", width: 50%)


In relation to revenue:
- with a lower PED (inelastic), it is lucrative to increase the price as it increases total revenue.
- with a higher PED (elastic), it is lucrative to decrease the price as it increase total revenue.


====== Factors of PED:


+ *Substitutes* - if there are many substitutes, PED is higher (proportional)
+ *Necessities* - if the good is a necessity, PED is lower (inversely proportional)
+ *Time* - The longer it takes for a consumer to change products, the higher the PED (proportional)
+ *Proportion of Income* - The higher the proportion of income spent on a good, the higher the PED (proportional)
+ *Utility* - The higher the util value of a good, the higher the PED (proportional)
+ *Additivity* - The more addictive a good is, the higher the PED (proportional)


====== Applications of PED


==== Income Elasticity of Demand


The responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in disposable income. The formula for YED is the same as PED, but with income instead of price. (It is not IED as IED stands for something different)


YED is equal to the change in quantity demand over the change in income.
$(% Delta D)/(% Delta I)$


====== Determinants of YED


#image("graphics/YED.png", width: 50%)


====== Applications of YED


+ YED, Producers and the Economic Cycle.
 - Economic growth -> Rise in income -> Demand for goods with high YED increases.
 - Recession -> Fall in income -> Demand for goods with low YED increases.


+ YED and the Economy
 - High YED for services
 - Medium YED for manufactured goods
 - Low YED for primary commodities


==== Cross Elasticity of Demand
Cross elasticity of demand (XED) illustrates the elasticity of a change in press for a good X compared to the change in demand for a good Y. It is measured by the percentage change in quantity demanded for good X divided by the percentage change in price of good Y.


XED is equal to the change in quantity demand for good X over the change in price of good Y.
$(% Delta D_X)/(% Delta P_Y)$


===== Determinants of XED


- If XED is positive, the goods are substitutes
- If XED is negative, the goods are complements


===== Applications of XED
- Similar products
- Rival firms
- Mergers between firms
- Complementary goods

=== Supply


"The amount of an economic good that can be produced at a certain price point."


Supply and *price* are _directly proportional_. This means that as the price of a good *increases*, the supply for it *increases* (typically). So a change in price results in movement along the supply curve.


#image("graphics/supply.png", width: 50%)


==== Non-price Determinants of Supply
+ Cost of production - A higher cost of production means that less can be produced (inversely proportional)
+ technology - Better technology means that more can be produced at a lower cost (proportional)
+ Indirect taxes - if indirect taxes increase, supply decreases (inversely proportional)
+ Subsidies - if subsidies increase, supply increases (proportional)
+ Natural factors - natural factors can lower supply (inversely proportional)
+ Price of related goods
 - Joint supply - if supply of a joint good increases, supply of the good increases (proportional)
 - Competitive supply - if supply of a competitive good increases, supply of the good decreases (inversely proportional)
+ Number of producers - if the number of producers increases, supply increases (proportional)
+ Expectations at firms - goods may be withhold if prices are expected to rise


#image("graphics/supply-shift.png", width: 75%)


==== Price Elasticity of Supply
A measure of the responsiveness of supply to a change in price. (*PES*)


PES = $(% Delta S) / (% Delta P)$


#image("graphics/PES.png", width: 100%)


===== Non-price factors of PES
- Time - the longer it takes to produce a good, the higher the PES (*proportional*)
- Mobility of factors of production - the more mobile the factors of production, the higher the PES (*proportional*)
- Wasted capacity - the more capacity wasted, the lower the PES (*proportional*)
- Shelf Life - the longer the shelf life, the higher the PES (*proportional*)


===== Applications of PES
+ Primary commodities have lower PES than manufactured goods because
 - Time to respond is higher
 - Low mobility
 - Limited land
 - Time is required to make investments for oil, gas and mineral production
 - Better irrigation systems are needed for cultivation of crops.

=== Markets


"the long awaited crossover of demand and supply"


#image("graphics/market.png", width: 75%)


The *market equilibrium* is where the _quantity supplied_ is equal to _quantity demanded_.




This equilibrium is reached by a *price mechanism* / *forces*.
- Excess *Supply*: $Q_s - Q_d$. When the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded, the price falls until the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.


- Excess *Demand*: $Q_d - Q_s$. When the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, the price rises until the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded.


When describing changes in equilibrium, keep in mind:
- Which curve it affects?
- Which curve replaces the other?
- What factors caused it to shift?
- What is the new equilibrium?
- What is the movement in the other curve?


== The Price Mechanism
also known as the *invisible hand*, *market mechanism*, *forces of supply and demand*, *market forces* or *resource allocation*. It is the process by which the price of a good is determined by the interaction of supply and demand. This occurs mostly in *free markets*


The condition of scarcity of resources and infinite wants forces decision makers to make decisions like:
- What to produce? (which point on the PPC)
- How to produce? (which combination and amount of resources)


There are two functions that makes up the price mechanism:
- The signalling function
 - Prices communicate information to decision makers about whether to leave or enter markets.
- The incentive function
 - Prices motivate decision makers to respond to the information.


== Economies
An economy is a system that attempts to solve the economic problem.


There are 3 major types of economies:
+ The free market
 - Entities have complete freedom.
 - Economic goods are determined by market forces
+ The mixed economy
 - Use both free and command economy ideology
 - Some government intervention to prevent market failure.
+ The command economy
 - Government makes all decisions
 - Can be rather inefficient due to lack of information.


=== Mixed Economies
The main focus of this course is on mixed economies. This is because they are the most common type of economy in the world.


It is made up of two different sectors, the private sector and the public sector.




Public goods have two characteristics.
- Non-excludable
 - Once the good is in the market, no consumer can be prevented or excluded from the consumption of the good.
- Non-rivalrous
 - Consumption of a product doesn't deplete the amount for others.


These two characteristics lead to the *free rider problem*. A free rider is someone who consumes a public good without paying for it. This leads to a situation where the public sector is unable to recover the costs of producing the good.


Private goods do not face these issues.


==== Private Sector
The private sector comprises individual entities like a sole trader, partnerships or companies/firms.


Aims: (production of private goods)
- Survival and _profit_
- Growth
- Social responsibility


==== Public Sector
The public sector comprises central governed organizations, state owned enterprises or local authority services (non-exhaustive.)


Aims: (production of public goods)
- Improve _quality_ of services
- Minimize costs, maximize profits.
- allow for *social cost* + benefit.


==== Privatization
The transfer of a business, industry or service from public to private control and ownership.

=== Market Failure
A situation where there is an inefficient distribution of economic goods as well as raw materials in the market.


The free rider problem is an example of market failure.


Other cases include:
- Externalities
- Lack of competition
- Missing markets
- Lack of information
- Low mobility of factors of production


==== Externalities
Externalities are one of the major market failures discussed. Externalities are the cost or benefit of an economic activity onto a third party. These are described as a spill-over effect.


Externalities are a result of consumption or production.


There are also private costs and benefits, these are costs incurred or benefits of economic activity onto the first party.


This leads to social costs and benefits, the sum of private and external costs and benefits.


Social cost = private cost + external cost


Social benefit = private benefit + external benefit


#linebreak()


So what does the government do about externalities?


- Negative production externalities
 - Government regulations
 - Taxes on output
 - Taxes on pollutants


- Negative consumption externalities
 - Government regulations
 - Advertising against the good
 - Market based policies (payments)
   - indirect taxes.


- Positive production externalities
 - Direct government provision
 - Subsidies


- Positive consumption externalities
 - Legislation (compulsory education on topics like vaccines or medicine)
 - Advertising
 - Direct provision
 - Subsidizing consumption


=== Production
There are 4 factors of Production


- Land (Rent)
- Labour (Wage)
- Capital (Interest)
- Enterprise (Profit)


In production, there are 3 major sectors
- Primary, responsible for production of raw materials and natural resources (capital goods)
- Secondary, responsible for production of manufactured goods
- Tertiary, responsible for production of services


These 3 sectors can also describe the development of an economy


#image("graphics/sectors.png", width: 75%)


==== Productivity
The measure of output per unit of input.


Factors that affect productivity:
- land
- labour
- capital


==== Divison of Labour
A concept to increase productivity by separating tasks into a production cycle to allow for *specialized* workers.


Advantages:
- Increase in production
- Time saving
- Lower unit cost
- Higher employment
- Larger scale production


Disadvantages:
- Repetition, bored
- requires financial incentive
- Lower mobility of labour
- Increased interdependence.


#pagebreak()


==== Economies of scales
#image("graphics/lrac.png", width:75%)


Economies of scale is measured using the *LRAC* curve. The LRAC curve is the _long run average cost curve_. It is the *average cost* of producing a good over a longer period of time.


LRAC is split into 3 parts:
- Economies of scale
- Constant cost
- Diseconomies of scale


What are economies of scale?
- Economies of scale (EOS) refers to the _decrease_ in *average cost* of production in relation to the output _increasing_.
- Diseconomies of scale (dEOS) refers to the _increase_ in *average cost* of production in relation to the output _increasing_.


Under economies of scale, there are internal and External economies of scale.
Internal economies of scale only benefit the firm that grows, whereas external economies of scale benefits all the firms when an industry grows.


_Internal_ Economies of Scale:
- *Purchasing*
 - Bulk buying materials at a lower price
- *Marketing*
 - Large firms can pay less for more advertising
- *Technical*
 - Large firms can afford to invest in more advanced technology
- *Financial*
 - Large firms can borrow more money at a lower interest rate
- *Risk Bearing*
 - Large firms can take more risks
- *Managerial*
 - Large firms can afford specialists for certain jobs


_External_ Economies of Scale:
- *Skilled labour*
 - Firms are able to take advantage of better skilled labour
- *Infrastructure*
 - Infrastructure makes it easier to produce
- *Suppliers*
 - there are more suppliers creating price competition
- *Similar businesses* in area
 - there is more innovation in the market.


*Diseconomies of scale*:
- Bureaucracy
 - Paper work increases with larger firms
- Communication
 - Large number of staff is challenging to communicate with
- Lack of control
 - Workers can slack off without being caught
- Distance of employees
 - Harder for top level employees and executive officers to understand labourers


==== Competition
firms compete with other firms to sell their goods to a consumer.


There are several types of market. The most popular 4 discussed are:
- Perfect competition (Perfectly competitive)
- Oligopoly
- Duopoly
- Monopoly (Pure monopoly)

 [low control over price], [some control over price], [high control over price], [high control over price],
 [high information about product.], [low information], [closed information], [closed information],
)


===== Monopolies
(not the board game)


A monopoly is a market structure where there is only one seller of a good or service. The single firm dominates the market.


This single farm is the price maker or price setter.


Common barriers of entry are patents, government regulations, and high start up costs.


Pros and Cons:
- Efficiency:
 - Natural monopolies on markets like rail travel or utilities like gas are more efficient
 - Otherwise, there is a lack of incentive to be efficient.


- Innovation
 - More finance to invest into research and development
 - However, there is no incentive to innovate


- Economies of scale
 - Can exploit EOS to lower production costs


- High prices are Lucrative (inelastic goods)


- Restricted Choice:
 - unique good
 - no competition
 - only one choice for consumers (no substitutes)


===== Oligopolies


When a few large firms dominate a market with close substitutes. Typically, there is non-price competition like advertising, loyalty or product differentiation.


In oligopolies, collusions and cartels often take place. These are illegal agreements between firms to set prices and output values in order to profit more.

Pros and Cons:
- More choice
- Higher quality
- Economies of scale
- Innovation
- Price wars
- Collusion & Cartels

===== Effects of Competition


Competition & *Firms*:
- *Efficiency*: More pressure to be efficient to keep price low. (negative)
- *Price*: Can't charge high prices. (negative)
- *Innovation*: Constant innovation required. (negative)
- *Choice*: Pressure for product differentiation and brand image. (negative)
- *Quality*: Pressure to provide good quality. (negative)


Competition & *Consumers*:efficiency (positive)
- *Quality*: Higher quality goods. (positive)
- *Innovation*: More innovation. (positive)


Competition & *Economy*:
- *Efficiency*: Resources are allocated more effectively. (positive)
- *Innovation*: Standards of living improve. (postive)

== The Labour Market 
Describing the market of workers for a certain firm or product. The supply of workers to the demand at a certain wage point.

The price of labour is wage.

#image("graphics/labour.png", width:75%)

The labour graph is very similar to that of an economic good, where the supply and demand of labour is shown. The equilibrium wage is the point where the supply and demand of labour meet.

Similar to the market forces for a good, wages for labour are determined by the forces of supply and demand. However, the wages can also be changed by trade unions or minimum wages set by governments.

=== Demand of labour
The demand of labour is the amount of workers that a firm wants to hire at a certain wage. The demand of labour is affected by:
- Demand for product
- Availability of labour substitutes
- The productivity of labour
- Other employment costs

=== Supply of labour
The supply of labour is the amount of workers that are willing to work at a certain wage. The supply of labour is affected by:
- Population size
- Migration
- Age distribution of population
- Retirement age
- School leaving age
- Female participation
- Skills
- Mobility of Labour

=== Labour Mobility
The ability of workers to move from one job to another.

There are 3 types of labour mobility:
- *Geographical mobility*
 - The ability of workers to move from one geographical area to another easily.
- *Occupational mobility*
 - The ability of workers to move from one job to another easily.
- *Industrial mobility*
 - The ability of workers to move from one industry to another easily. (or sector)

Education and training increases labour mobility.
- Labour mobility boosts supply of labour in markets.

=== Trade Unions

Trade unions are organisations that represent workers in negotiations with employers and are formed in order to protect the interests of workers.. They are also known as labour unions.

Aims:
- Negotiate pay
- Provide legal pay / protection in a case against employees
- Improve worker rights
- Provide financial benefit and strike pay

Strong trade unions can force higher wages in markets when it hasd full support fromn the workers. 

Companies also depend on the quality and quantity of labour in a market. Labour needs to meet the skills and count to maintain production and quality.

== Government intervention

Governments intervene to stop stupid things from happening. If they don't intervene, business may neglect certain stake holders.

Externality interventions:
- taxations
- subsidies
- fines
- regulation
- pollution permits

Governments also regulate Competition
- promote competition
- limit monopoly power
- protect consumer interest
- control merges and takeovers

Governments also intervene in the labour market
- Minimum wage
- Unemployment benefits
- Training and education
- Trade unions
