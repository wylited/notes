* Forces and Motion
** Double Science

Thinking Distance:
- Tiredness/energy of driver
- Age of driver
- Alcohol/drug consumption
- Distractions

Braking Distance:
- Mass/weight of car
- Condition of breaks
- Condition of tyres
- Slope of road

Terminal Velocity:
- Air resistance > weight
- Resultant force is upwards (air resistance = weight)
- constant speed is achieved (no acceleration)

** Triple Science
