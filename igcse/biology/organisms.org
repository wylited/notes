* Organisms

** Nature
All *Living* organims have the characterstics:
 - Need Nutrition
 - Respire
 - Excrete
 - Homeostasis
 - Move
 - Have Sensitivity
 - Reproduce
 - Grow

If they cant do this, they aren't qualified as living.

** Variety
There are a variety of living organisms, split into eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Common differences table.

| Eukaryotes                | Prokaryotes       |
| Usually **multicellular** | **Unicellular**   |
| More complex cell         | Less complex      |
| DNA in nucleus            | DNA in cytoplasm  |
| Mitochondria              | No Mitochondria   |
| Larger Ribosomes          | Smaller Ribosomes |

*** Eukaryotes
- Either mutlicellular or unicellular
- Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protocists

**** Plants
- Multicellular
- Have chloroplasts, cell walls (cellulose) and permanent vacuoles.
- Store carbohydrates as starch or sucrose
- eg: Maize, roses, peas, beans literally any plant

**** Animals
- Multicellular
- No cell walls
- Store carbohydrates as glycogen
- Have nervous coordination
- eg: Insects, Humans, Horses, Mice

**** Fungi
- Are a **mycellium**, made from thread like structures called **hyphae**
- Some are multicellular, some are unicellular
- Chitin cell wall
- **Saprotrophic** nutrition
  - They use extracellular secretion of digestive enzymes onto food
- Store carbohydrates as glycogen
- eg: Mucor, Yeast

**** Protocists
- Microscopic, unicellular organisms.
- eg: Amoeba, Chlorella, Plasmodium

*** Prokaryotes
- Unicellular only
- Bacteria and Archaea (??)

**** Bacteria
- Lack a nucleus, instead carry DNA in cytoplasm
- **Plasmids**
- Some do photosynthesis
- Lactobaccilus lugaricus: Makes yogurt from milk
- Pneumococcus: causes pneumonia

*** Pathogens
Organisms that cause diseases

**** Viruses
Parasites, ew.
- Not considered living
- No cellular structure but they have a **protein coat**
- Contain either DNA or RNA
- eg: Influenza (FLU), HIV (AIDS)

** Structure
**Organisms** are made up of **systems** which are made up of **organs** which are made up of **tissues** which are made up of **cells** which are made up of **organelles**.
