#+title: Cloning

* Stages
1) A donor cell is taken from the target animal
   1) Any cell will work, however, using a cell that is more active will result in a higher chance of the DNA working well.
2) An egg cell is taken from a female animal
3) The nucleus of that cell is removed
4) The donor cell and foreign egg cell are fused together using an electric shock.
5) Since the fused cell has enough chromosomes, it begins dividing normally.
6) This develops into an embryo which is placed in the uterus of a foster mother.
7) The embryo develops normally into the animal.

* Problems
- Can lead to a variety of defects in vital organs, such as the liver, brain and heart.
- Premature aging.
- Problems with immune system.
- Can be misused easily.
- High level of uncertainty and unreliability, making it not a safe process.
- Ethical concerns with cloning.
